# minecraft-templates
A bunch of Gnu's Not Unix Image Manipulator Program (GIMP) Minecraft templates for ores and stuff. Useful for modding and not using agenerator or something like cowards do.

# How to use:
1. Open the template.
2. Open the background block (for ores) and optionally a colour style image if you don't want to paint it in.
3. Go into the respective images, CTRL + A, CTRL + C.
4. Go into the Block (for ores, duh) or Colour layer.
5. CTRL + V
6. Repeat 2-5 if there are any left.
7. CTRL + E > MySickOreThanksDeltaNedas.png > Enter
